    Singly linked list cycle check

    Problem:
        Given a singly linked list, write a function which takes in the
        first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating
        if the linked list contains a cycle.
        A cycle is when a node's next point actually points back to a previous
        node in the list.
